      My take on the DBC experience:
      The more I know how DBC works the intrigued I am. It is a totally new way for me to learn. Up until now my education has been the traditional classroom style. The idea of being totally hands on and learning by doing/exploring is new to me. It is not mere memorization. I see myself engaging the DBC experience by simply allowing myself to embrace the propgram. It's a new experience. It is a new way of engaging the learning process. I'm excited and scared by the process. I realized that the "global" reason I entered the DBC program was for reinvention. A new way of learning should be part of it, no matter how daunting is may be. To say I'm nervous is a HUGE undestatement. I am commiting a huge amount of time and money to this program. I don't want to fail. I want to excell. Part of my nervousness is that I am placing so much on completing this program. I am desperate to reinvent myself personally and professionally. However I cannot let that worry and fear take controll. It is a certain way to set oneself for failure.
