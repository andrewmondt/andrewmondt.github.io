      I’m learning a lot about my learning style. More importantly I’m learning what i need to work on to make my learning style better. I scored really high on the “Abstract Random” scale. I realize fifteen questions is not a very detailed measure. Once upon a time I created these kind of questionnaires in my undergrad psychology major.

      see myself in the positives. I do best when I have access to experts or references. I am never afraid to ask a question. I learned long ago that there is no such thing as a stupid question. If I have the question the odds are pretty good that I am not the only one. Stimulating environments also makes sense as I can easily get board and lose my focus.

      Unfortunately I saw my negatives as well. The two examples are something I seriously need to work on. The biggest issue is concentrating on one thing at a time. This is why I am feeling like I am floundering in phase 0. I don’t work well on my own. I talk myself out of feeling like I am able to succeed. Being in a controlled environment with others works best for me. I have to learn to exhale, slow down and take the test at hand piece by piece. The most frightening response is that I am unable to give exact details. Isn’t programing all about exact details? Garbage in always equals garbage out. A final issue is accepting criticism. To a certain, irrational extent, I hide from others when they have anything to say about me or my work. I need to get over that.

      These revelations point out how I need to expand to a open learning mindset. I need to focus on the positive aspects of my learning. That will allow me to succeed. Fear doen’t help anybody I’m working with, let alone myself.
