    <p>I absolutely love pairing! I’m a social creature. I don’t do well on my own. Pairing keeps me focused and engaged on my coding classes. I find it really rewarding as it allows me to see that I am not the only person with struggles or concerns about what we are learning. I get some perspective That I am not in this alone and I am not doing as horribly as I think I am. This is all very rewarding.

    <p>The feedback is a great tool. I was very apprehensive about it at first. I have to take it personally yet not too personally. The person giving the feedback was not out to attack or belittle me. They are here to help me. It’s okay to learn what I need to change or work on more. We are all in the same boat.
