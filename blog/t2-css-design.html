      Margin, Border and Padding can be thought of as a nest around your code. The closest part to your code,table,image etc is padding. It surrounds the item. It is affected by the background color. It could be cosidered as the mounting around a framed picture. It is a buffer between the item and the frame. Just like a a picture has a frame an element has a border. The border is created in the CSS. It could be a solid line, dashes etc. The border can be customized to certain a certain thickness or color. Finally the margin is determins how close other html elements will be to the item. An example would be how close a block of text wraps around an image. A margin will keep that text or other website elements a certain distance from the element.

      Classes and Ids accomplish many of the same tasks. However classes are much more useful.  Ids are very specific. They only reference the specific code they are attached to. Ids can only be used for that one referenced code. Classes are much more flexible as you can attach them to different parts of the code repeatedly. Using classes can be more efficient for many differant areas of the site. An id would be good for a piece of code that only appears once.

      Positioning is a bit of a puzzle that needs to be solved in order for one's site to work properly. Relative positioning allows you place an object "relative" to the page it is on. It can be moved all around the screen and will overide any fixed or absolute items. An item can also be relative to its parent item in the flow of the CSS. This can make for confusion but if designed well, will make for a dynamic site. Absolute positioning is not affected by other elements on the page. Fixed positioning places an item on the page and it will stay regardless of interaction or scrolling. Examples of this are those annoying advertising banners you see as you are scrolling down a page on your portable device. They can be used as click bate to navigate you to another site.

      To display something inline means that it will simply go along the flow of the code. It follows the settings of the code it is in. It doesn't break out from the line of code. It doesn't have an inline break before or after it. It just "goes with flow" of where it is placed.
      An inline block can have its own formating as how it will look in the line of code. It will be allowed to "do its own thing" regardless of where it is in the line of code.
