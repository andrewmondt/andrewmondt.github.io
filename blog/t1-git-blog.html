      The benifits of version control:
      Version control is vital to keeping code in order. If the primary code is being updated constantly there is now way to track what worked and more importatnly what didn't! As each update to the code is tracked it is easier to go to that code if there are any problems that may be breaking the build. It allows the coder to go back to earlier versions to compare and contrast. it keeps everything tidy and neat while avoiding unessicary work to find the issue.

      Github and changes:
      Github allows you to track your changes by creating forks that can be updated or reforked. It shows a path of updates. If there is an issue it can be easily found and addressed to work on any issues that may have come up. As importantly it allows you to "go back in time" to the last build that worked without contaminating the main code.

      Why use Github:
      Github offers several advantages over storing the code locally. Having you code "in the cloud" ensures that a copy is available if there is a crash on you local system. The biggest advantage is that many people can be working on the project. It doesn't matter where they physically are. It facilitates colaborate workflow.
