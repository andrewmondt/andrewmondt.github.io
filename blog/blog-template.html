    <p>The next variable type is an array. An array is a list. Think of your grocery list. You have a array called grocery list. Your grocery list has a series of items. so your array could look like this. groceries = [“eggs”, “milk”, “coffee”]. You take your list to the grocery store and as you go down the list pick up each item on the list.

    <p>A hash is a like a dictionary. So in the dictionary you look for a word to find its definition. So if we look up “cat” in the dictionary is will return with “a four legged mammal with claws that wants to rule the world”. If we were looking through the dictionary as an array we would have to look for word 10,587. We would have to look through all the words prior to cat to find the definition. Is 1 cat? No, is 2 cat? and so on. Thats not very efficient. In a hash we would look for the word “cat”. Cat is the “key” to the definition of what a cat is. A hash can be considered a list of variables associated with keys that reference their value as a description. Its much easier to comprehend what is in a hash as each key should describe what it is pointing to. The computer has no problem searching an array or a hash. People on the other hand are better at searching hashes as they are a descriptor of what’s in there and not some number.
