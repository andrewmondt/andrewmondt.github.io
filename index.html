	I'd like to welcome you to my dbc site so that you could learn a little more about me and my journey to a new career!
</p>
<p>
	I guess you could say I've always been a geek. Luckily, nowadays that is a good thing to embrace! My first experience with coding was with my Commodore 64. It is the "Model T" of the computer age. It was cheap, reliable and allowed the user to program the daylights out of it! 
</p>
<p>
	I decided that I needed a serious career reinvention. After much thought I realized that I needed to embrace my lifelong fascination with tech and make it my next career.
